The technology gradually developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
