<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately turn off the heater. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can instantly make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective burglars.</p>
