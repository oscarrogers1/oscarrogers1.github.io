<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

Commercial cameras exceed their cheaper cousins since they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adapt and catch exceptional low light video.</p>
