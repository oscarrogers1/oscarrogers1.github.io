<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most hard setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You need to play this at full volume or it won't work).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
