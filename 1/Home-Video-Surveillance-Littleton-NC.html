In terms of detection, it is much better to have actually a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will provide more precise and less regular notifies because many times the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
<p>4G Wireless works similar to a mobile phone. The modem connects to the internet much like a mobile phone. One of the things to consider with this alternative is not only is a sim card required but likewise a cellular modem and a switch would need to be enclosed in an enclosure if the camera is put outside, this is presuming there is a close-by power supply if not a solar panel would be required. Also remember there would be a regular monthly fee for utilizing a 4G network comparable to internet, if you don't pay the bill the cameras would have no signal. This is not a good option for homes or business' in the country where cellular phone service is limited.</p>
