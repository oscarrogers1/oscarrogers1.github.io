When people are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
