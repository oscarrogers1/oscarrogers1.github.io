<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to save and for how long you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly.
