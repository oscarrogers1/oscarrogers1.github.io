<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

It also includes two days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of as much as 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the 4 mentioned that utilizes a mix of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind when making a decision.</p>

ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful residents with mobile phones is better security than one security person enjoying 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>
