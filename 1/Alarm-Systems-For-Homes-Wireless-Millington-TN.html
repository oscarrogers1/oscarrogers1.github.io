Residence has actually upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better range for sensors. Both the initial Abode system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit.
