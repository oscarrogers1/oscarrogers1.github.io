<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
