<p>Analog high definition cameras are a great choice for businesses to upgrade from analog CCTV that has already been wired utilizing coax cable or CAT-5 cable. AHD cameras utilize the very same RG59 or RG6 cable television as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can also be utilized. While pro monitoring expenses more, it's more secure.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.
