We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey.

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being viewed know they're being watched, and you can choose to record video or pictures and conserve them to your smart device on an impulse.</p>
