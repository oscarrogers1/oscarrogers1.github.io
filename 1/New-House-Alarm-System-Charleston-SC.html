<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision choice, but the black and white version can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality video.

<p>Nest thoughtfully creates its equipment and packages too; it consists of two crucial fobs with every security equipment plan-- that's typically an add-on. In terms of smarts, you have motion and noise detection, and the app will signal you when either takes place (you can adjust the level of sensitivity as needed).

<p>We also love that Ring still has decent clever home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with smart home devices like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your total security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is relatively simple.
