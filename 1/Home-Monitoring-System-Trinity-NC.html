<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should offer at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to correctly identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording spaces throughout crucial security events.
