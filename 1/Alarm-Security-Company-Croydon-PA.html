However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
