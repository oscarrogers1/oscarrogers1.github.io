<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so crucial?

Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have a powerful solution for catching wrongdoers and gathering evidence.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on created to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the keys can check out all the traffic.</p>
