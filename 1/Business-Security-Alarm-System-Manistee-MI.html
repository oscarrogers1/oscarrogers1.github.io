<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
