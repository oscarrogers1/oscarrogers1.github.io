It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative clever home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
