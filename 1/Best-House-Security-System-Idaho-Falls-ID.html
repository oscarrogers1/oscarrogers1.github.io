<p>When it comes to how to use one, they work the same as the majority of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. Often you do not even need to hardwire them, depending on which model you choose. Similar to any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets. When you add wise cameras to any Blue system, and that price jumps a lot. We like that you can select from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every smart camera Blue deals is $200.</p>
