The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
