<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
