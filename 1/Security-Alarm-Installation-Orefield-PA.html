Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

Also, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas. To hold and recoup costs alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you.
