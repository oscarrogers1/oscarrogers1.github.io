Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to keep and for how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
