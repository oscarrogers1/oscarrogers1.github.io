Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
