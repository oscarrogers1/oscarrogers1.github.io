<p>Spend some time to check out online reviews and not simply those on the company's website. Look at the Better Business Bureau website specifically. If a consumer has actually a lodged a complaint about the company, its personnel, or its equipment, it will be on that site. Other third-party reviews sites must be checked also. Consider asking next-door neighbors for suggestions on security systems too. They might even suggest a local company with a strong track record that can expertly install the equipment.</p>

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security guard. Several cities also need a permit to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>

A local system does not have the capacity to couple with other clever gadgets and can not be controlled remotely. Also a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it simply triggers an audible siren to signal people nearby.</p>
