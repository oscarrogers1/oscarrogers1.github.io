Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom gives you a wide range of powerful functions to secure your home or business.</p>
<p>A lot of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to reap some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup.

Often, the simple presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more determined intruders. They may also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
