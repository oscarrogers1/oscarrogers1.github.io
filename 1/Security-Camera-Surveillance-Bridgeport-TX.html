That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape once again, which implies you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't suggest that for home security since if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>

Just a couple decades ago, the home security market was dominated by a couple of big names using expensive, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.

Now, most security systems include a variety of elements, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few parts.
