<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR.

This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe ought to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
