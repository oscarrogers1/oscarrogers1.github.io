<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive.
