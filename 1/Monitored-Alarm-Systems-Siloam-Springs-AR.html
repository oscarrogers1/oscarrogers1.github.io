<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software application and firmware.
