<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike property owners, typically prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other components can easily be established at various homes later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
