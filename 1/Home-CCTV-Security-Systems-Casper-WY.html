With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
