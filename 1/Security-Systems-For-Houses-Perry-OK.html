We are validating with Arlo whether our system was faulty, therefore we may revisit this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The large face of the camera gives you an impressive field of view, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that video, you can utilize an app on your phone or an internet browser link on your computer system.</p>

When selecting security cameras for your CCTV system, these are all crucial concerns to be thought about.</p>
