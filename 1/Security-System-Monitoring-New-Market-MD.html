DVR systems are hard to scale up because once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to acquire a completely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
