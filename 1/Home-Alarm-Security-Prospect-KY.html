<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies offer "free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Lots of insurance companies offer discounts on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many authorities departments use several "complimentary" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>

<p>The real reason cameras are generally released is to minimize much pettier criminal activities. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly released in public places, sociologists studying the issue have found that they have actually not decreased criminal activity. "As soon as the criminal activity and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the general down pattern in offenses and criminal activities," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in particular categories but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had lowered crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
