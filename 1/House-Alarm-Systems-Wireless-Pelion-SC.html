As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to deter things.

Eventually, he warns, "individuals may discover to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."
