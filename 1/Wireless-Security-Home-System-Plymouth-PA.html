PTZ cameras are remotely controlled, and enable the operator to pan (relocation left or right), tilt up and or down, or zoom better or further away in order to follow individuals as they move.

We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is very easy to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.
