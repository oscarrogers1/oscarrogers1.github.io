<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
