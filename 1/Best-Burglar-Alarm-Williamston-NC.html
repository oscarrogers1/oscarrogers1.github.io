The answer hinges on a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not need a new keypad. Utilizing several sensors to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources.
