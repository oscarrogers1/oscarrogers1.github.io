<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
