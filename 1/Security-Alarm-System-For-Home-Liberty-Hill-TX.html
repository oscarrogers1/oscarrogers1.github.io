<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense avoidance designed to avoid both personal and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, authorities.

It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower crime and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
