<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
