<p>Our 4 favorite nationwide suppliers-- Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe-- all have their location in the Emerald City. We dug into what each provider has to offer, and put those services in the context of Seattle crime and home security trends.

<p>Both of these cameras are geared up with 180 degrees, 1080p lenses with night vision capability, allowing you to have a clear view of a large area.

<p>What many people do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the general public, though not found in the big box and warehouse stores. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera used by these huge box chains to secure their stock. Take a look at the ceiling of customer electronics stores and storage facility chains and you will see in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical consumer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason that.</p>

<p>The loudest of the smart alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at cautioning anybody in your home and those neighboring that there's an issue. During testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to represent animals, too. The alarm is simply one of two we checked that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anybody from attempting to break in to your property. We tested Somfy's more expensive system, which included a wifi security camera, however more cost effective sets are also readily available. In spite of the large price here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>
