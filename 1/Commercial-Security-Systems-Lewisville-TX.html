<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
