<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; nevertheless, absolutely nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage option saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself.

Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
