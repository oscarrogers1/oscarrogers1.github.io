After the awful attacks, authorities evaluated CCTV camera footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, carrying backpacks packed with dynamites. The terrorists were recorded on several CCTV cameras, but unfortunately they were neither seen nor intercepted prior to they had the ability to perform the attacks.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
