<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce criminal activity. HD CCTV systems work with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that suggests you have standard analog CCTV security cameras.

Humans have 5 senses that jointly allow us to accurately vary our environment. For that reason, it only makes sense that a security system that engages as lots of senses as possible is more effective. And since it's not practical to engage taste, odor, and touch remotely, the most effective video surveillance systems combine sight and hearing to enhance security protection.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, but the white and black variation can actually be clearer and give you higher-quality footage. This isn't really a huge offer considering the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black.

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
