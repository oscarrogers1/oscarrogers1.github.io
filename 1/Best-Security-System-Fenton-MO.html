<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.
