<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
