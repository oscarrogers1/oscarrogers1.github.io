It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a learning period).
