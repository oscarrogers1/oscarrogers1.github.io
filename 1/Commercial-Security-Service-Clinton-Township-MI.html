The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month charge ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.
