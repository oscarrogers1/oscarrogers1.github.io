<p>Dependability is an extremely subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending on which functions and advantages a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still typical grievances.

<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the fact, which indicates that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of recording storage area. So much, in fact, that they require about four times the hard disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
