<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops reaction to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  technique to theft decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
