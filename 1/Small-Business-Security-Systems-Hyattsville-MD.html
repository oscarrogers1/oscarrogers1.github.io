As soon as we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we slanted the entire collection external for another two weeks to see what sort of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by.
