<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime prevention designed to prevent both individual and property criminal activity and can be used in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>On the surface area, these two camera classifications may appear similar, though if you had the ability to see inside, the differences become unique and obvious.

Usually, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or absent (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adapt and catch exceptional low light video, commercial cameras exceed their cheaper cousins.</p>
