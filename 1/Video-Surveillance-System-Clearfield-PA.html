<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra information that may never have been possible previously, such as notice of a staff member, by name and recognition number, going into the structure. An image of that worker is presented on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating takes place.</p>
