<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to store and the length of time you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

If  cops are called for a false alarm, homeowners may have to pay a fine for dispatching authorities unnecessarily.
