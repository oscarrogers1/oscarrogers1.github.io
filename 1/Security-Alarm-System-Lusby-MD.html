<p>While it hits the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still by far the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise.

The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for instance.

For each additional camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 per month for individual detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and functions storage as much as 31 days.</p>
