During testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was found. We like that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly.
