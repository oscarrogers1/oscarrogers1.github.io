<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
