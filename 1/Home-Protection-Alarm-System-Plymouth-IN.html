Professional installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
