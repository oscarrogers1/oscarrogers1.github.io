<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.
