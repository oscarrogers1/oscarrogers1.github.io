<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost.

Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and ineffective  approach to robbery reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
