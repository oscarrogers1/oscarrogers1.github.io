<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

The latter allows you to see specifically when a specific individual arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
