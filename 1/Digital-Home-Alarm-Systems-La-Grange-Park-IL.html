The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
