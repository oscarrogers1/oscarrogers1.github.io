<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
