When we got a good enough take a look at those friendly faces, we tilted the entire collection external for another 2 weeks to see what type of results we would get when the cameras faced your house throughout the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
