Get a complete photo of the crucial places other cameras can't reach. The wireless, weather-resistant Arlo Go uses LTE and your mobile strategy to go anywhere untethered. The app is hugely remarkable, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
