<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
