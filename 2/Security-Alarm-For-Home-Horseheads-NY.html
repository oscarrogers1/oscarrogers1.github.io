<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras lower criminal activity. HD CCTV systems work with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (take a look at the cord behind the TV that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that implies you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system. That's simply $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the Abode Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensing unit, and a remote key fob.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since most retail theft would not journey an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some additional money while providing a client change, for instance), we think it's more crucial to have top quality images so you have the evidence you require.

When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
