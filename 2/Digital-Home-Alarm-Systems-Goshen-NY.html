All significant alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, make use of proximity sensing units in the windows and doors as the first line of defense versus possible robbers, and alarm send info to a central monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement rapidly and effectively.</p>
<p>While not an important requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a variety of camera choices as add-ons.
