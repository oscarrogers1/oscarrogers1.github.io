A wired security camera can can be found in 2 forms, both requiring wires to provide power and for the functions of video transmission.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features.
