<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With years of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle businesses and homes, we have actually constructed excellent relationships with both local police and their consumers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and susceptible to exploits.

However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year contract, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years.
