In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly released in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not lowered criminal activity. "When the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to appraise the general downward pattern in criminal activities and offences," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had decreased crime overall in the city centre."
