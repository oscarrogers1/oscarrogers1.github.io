Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines groan, cats squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
