<p>Base stations are the center of a security system, utilizing WiFi and wireless innovation to connect all the different sensing units, cameras, and other system elements. Range extenders are utilized for bigger homes because the majority of base stations usually only have a range of a couple hundred feet. Night vision. Evening is among the biggest areas of issue for house owners, so naturally, you desire your camera to be able to work at night. Many cameras include infrared ability. The range of the night vision differs so ensure you're getting a beneficial visual distance.</p>
