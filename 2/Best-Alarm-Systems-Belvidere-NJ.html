<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, centers, and others. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means web procedure) network, typically the same information network the rest of a company utilizes. A separate network using category 5 electrical wiring can be utilized if bandwidth is an issue. In any case, video details is taped on a server, which means video information can be found on site or in a remote location. After testing, we sent each of our top choices, in addition to the Wyze Web cam v2, to Costs McKinley, head of info security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.
