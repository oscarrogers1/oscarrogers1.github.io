<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, including smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
