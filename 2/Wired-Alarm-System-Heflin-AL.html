Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
