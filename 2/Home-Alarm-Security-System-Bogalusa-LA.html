When it spotted any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would inform users. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the current system.</p>

These DVRs are great for those consumers as well due to the fact that every channel supports video recording at any resolution (D1, 960H, 720p, 1080p, 5MP).

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
