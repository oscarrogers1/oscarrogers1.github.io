The $260 Fundamentals package consists of the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a yard indication, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can add around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy adds control through iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and e-mail notifies, and 30-day event-footage storage for unrestricted cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered individually.
