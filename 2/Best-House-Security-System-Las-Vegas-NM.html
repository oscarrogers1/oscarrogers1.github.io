<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity avoidance developed to prevent both personal and property criminal activity and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
