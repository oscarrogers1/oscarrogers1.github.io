Your monitoring company will get the alert and then inform the authorities for you when something activates your alarm. Appears like a more secure bet to us.</p>
<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an infraction. Once a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
