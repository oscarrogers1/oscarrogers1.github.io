<p>As you just found out, there are two broad classifications of security cameras. What you usually find at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set. The second category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, normally begins at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a substantially higher rate. The video recorder should be purchased independently, and commercial grade recorders start at about $500 (United States $) and can range as much as $5000 depending on the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing functions.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
