<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
