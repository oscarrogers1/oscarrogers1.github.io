<h3>Cheap Security Cameras El Dorado Hills CA 95762</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life without a doubt.
