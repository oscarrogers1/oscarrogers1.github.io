<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
