The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, and so we might revisit this evaluation.
