Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation.

Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
