The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
