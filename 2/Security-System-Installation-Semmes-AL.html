<p>Numerous full-time" citizens with alarm systems tell us that they are home all the time" and question why they would require monitoring. However, individuals need to consider the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - rather than simply their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not?

<p>While monitored systems are more thorough and do most of the work for you, an unmonitored system depends on somebody accountable (we're looking at you) to help do some of the work. You can normally install these systems by yourself, and they are much, much less costly. Likewise, there's no worry of entering into an agreement you can't escape when you require to. The financial independence alone makes this alternative better for some families. Additionally, most unmonitored security systems will send out signals to your smart device, making it simple to understand if there's a hazard to your property.</p>
