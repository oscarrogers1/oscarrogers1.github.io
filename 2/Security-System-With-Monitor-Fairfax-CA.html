The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive aggressor to tape-record these codes and utilize different breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key captured throughout the network healing.</p>

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
