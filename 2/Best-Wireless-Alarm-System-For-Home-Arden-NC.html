Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.

We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
