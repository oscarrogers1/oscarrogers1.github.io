The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive attacker to tape these codes and utilize different breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
