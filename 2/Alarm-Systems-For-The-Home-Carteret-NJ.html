We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
