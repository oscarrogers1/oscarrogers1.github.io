<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and how long you prepare to keep documented video. The footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>
<p>IP cameras also have additional features that analog cameras do not use, such as video analytics, which allow for mobile alerts and automatic recording if there is movement within the camera's field of view.
