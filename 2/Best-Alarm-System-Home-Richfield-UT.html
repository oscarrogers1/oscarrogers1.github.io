<p>Like the Canary, the Somfy One is a tiny Complete HD camera with built-in 90dB siren. Plus, it works with Nest products, Google Assistant and Amaxon Alexa, and the brand also provides a variety of cameras, sensors and expert sirens, making it pretty flexible. The significant selling point here nevertheless is its ability to not offer incorrect alarms - the camera has two sensing units, one identifying motion, and one looking for modifications in temperature level (body heat) and it requires both sensing units to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll look out.</p>
