<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic smart home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for prospective package burglars or talk with visitors who drop in.</p>

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
