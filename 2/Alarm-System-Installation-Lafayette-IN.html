CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by changing a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
