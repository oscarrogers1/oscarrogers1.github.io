The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>In its truest form, a CCTV camera is an analog video camera that sends signals through coax cable to a single central area for video, monitoring, and recording analysis.
