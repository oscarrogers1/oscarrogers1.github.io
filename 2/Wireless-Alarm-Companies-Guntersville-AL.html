This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
