You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals might discover to be careful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers."
