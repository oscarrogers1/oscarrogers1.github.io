This is likewise referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by changing a range of systems such as increasing the danger of an offender being collared, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
