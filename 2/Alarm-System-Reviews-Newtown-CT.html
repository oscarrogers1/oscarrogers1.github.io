CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be minimized by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of an offender being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
