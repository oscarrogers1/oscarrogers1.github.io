<p>Thanks to recent improvements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you should think about the following advantages of wireless innovation. The $260 Basics bundle includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a yard sign, and two window decals. For $15 per month, you can include around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan includes control by means of iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and email alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for limitless cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available individually.

For instance, Scout only provides one security camera (and it's for indoor usage just). If you want a couple of more sets of eyes on your residential or commercial property, however, Scout Alarm integrates with Nest Cams, which can send out motion notices to your Scout app.</p>
