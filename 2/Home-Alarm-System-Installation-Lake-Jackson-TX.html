<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating unit at 5am. The very first guard arrived early so he could look at the whole location and talk with me about my concerns. He was expert, really reassuring and courteous. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took control of. When I showed up in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, encouraging and considerate.
