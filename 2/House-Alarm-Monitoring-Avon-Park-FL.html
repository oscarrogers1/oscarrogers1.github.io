<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send notifies, make certain it deals with other wise devices. Many recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras offer support for IFTTT (If This Then That), a web service that uses tiny programs (applets) that you create to have the camera connect with other IFTTT-enabled devices.
