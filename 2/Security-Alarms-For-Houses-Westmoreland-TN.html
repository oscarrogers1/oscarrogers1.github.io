The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today.

Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Even we need to install cameras in our home. I have likewise installed Revo security cameras in my home.</p>
