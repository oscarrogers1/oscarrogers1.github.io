<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
