<p>Blink cameras are compact, include totally free storage, and use two AA batteries that can last as much as 2 years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you.
