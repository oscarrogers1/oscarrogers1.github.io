<p>We needed guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold occasion to secure the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heater at 5am. The first guard showed up early so he might look at the entire area and talk to me about my issues. He was professional, extremely comforting and polite. The second guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also expert, considerate and comforting.
