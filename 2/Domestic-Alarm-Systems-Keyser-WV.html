<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
