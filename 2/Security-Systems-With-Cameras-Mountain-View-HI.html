<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you've identified (after a learning duration).

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over cross countries.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
