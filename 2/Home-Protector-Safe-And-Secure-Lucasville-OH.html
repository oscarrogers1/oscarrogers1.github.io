<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security innovations.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by.
