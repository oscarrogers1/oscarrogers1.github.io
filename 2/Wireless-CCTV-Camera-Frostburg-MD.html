Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
