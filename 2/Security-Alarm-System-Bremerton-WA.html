<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another reason to read your existing alarm agreement thoroughly. ADT for example provides free" home security systems when you sign up for their multiyear alarm monitoring plan. Clearly nothing is totally free. In this case the alarm company owns the primary equipment such as control panel, keypad, motion sensing unit. Anything included additional you would own but if you do not restore their high priced strategy they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm. Just another sly technique to keep highly lucrative accounts.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free perks like individual detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time consistently disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
