We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

<p>Several monitors were set up within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm displays. Once any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that area would be displayed on that particular monitor.
