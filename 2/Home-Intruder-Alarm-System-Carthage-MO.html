We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is really easy to use, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices.

<p>Security through SimpliSafe has everything you want however at a portion of the cost.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
