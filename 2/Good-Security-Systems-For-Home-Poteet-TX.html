<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>When combined with face recognition, surveillance camera networks raise additional personal privacy and civil rights concerns-- particularly due to the fact that face acknowledgment data is prone to mistake.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer.
