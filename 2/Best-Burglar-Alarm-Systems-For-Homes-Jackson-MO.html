This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone selection and HDR assistance for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery option here, sorry-- but the camera features a 25-foot power cord, which must aid with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
