This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone selection and HDR assistance for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery option here, sorry-- but the camera features a 25-foot power cord, which must aid with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
