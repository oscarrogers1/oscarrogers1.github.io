This system is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more flexible. When they open, contact sensors are the very first thing you must buy along with the base station; these connect to doors and windows and will notify you. Other home security elements include motion sensing units, keypads, essential fobs, cameras, glass-break sensing units, and panic buttons.</p>
