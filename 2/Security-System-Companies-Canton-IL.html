<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning numerous years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and watch it later on.

<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, but the white and black version can really be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage. This isn't truly a huge deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the help of solar energy with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
