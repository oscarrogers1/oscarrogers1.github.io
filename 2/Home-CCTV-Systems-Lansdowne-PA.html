<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
