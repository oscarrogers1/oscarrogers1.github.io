It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of recording storage space.

So is the prepare for recordings from several cameras: $10 a month or $100 a year.</p>
