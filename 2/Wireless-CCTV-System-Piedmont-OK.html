The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by.
