<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Tenants, unlike house owners, typically prevent making permanent changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be established at various properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too.
