<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas.

Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members."

For many homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive.
