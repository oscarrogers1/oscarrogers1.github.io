<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, hotels, and centers. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP stands for web procedure) network, typically the very same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is a problem, a separate network using classification 5 electrical wiring can be utilized. In either case, video info is recorded on a server, which means video information can be found on site or in a remote location.

I ordered a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am quite convenient to install it myself.
