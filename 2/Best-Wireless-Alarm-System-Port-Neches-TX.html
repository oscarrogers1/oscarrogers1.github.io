<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Since it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I purchased 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually excellent. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
