<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
