It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you imagine a home security camera.</p>
<p>This totally depends on your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensing units and equipment than somebody who lives in a studio apartment.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to advise as a top pick.</p>
