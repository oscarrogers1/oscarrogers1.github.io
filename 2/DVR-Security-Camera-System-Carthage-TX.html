<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
