<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert.

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
