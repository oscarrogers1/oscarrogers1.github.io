<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is truly fantastic.
