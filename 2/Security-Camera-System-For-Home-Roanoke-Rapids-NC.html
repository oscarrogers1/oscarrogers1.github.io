While enhancements in the last few years have made the innovation more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
