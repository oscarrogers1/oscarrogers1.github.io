<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might revisit this evaluation.
