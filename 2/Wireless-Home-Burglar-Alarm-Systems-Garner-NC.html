The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
