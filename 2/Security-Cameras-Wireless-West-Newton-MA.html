<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee. We recommend the eight-piece kit because it features multiple door and window sensors for full protection. We likewise suggest including a doorbell camera eventually. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Factor in the upfront cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring fees and all equipment. All of these expenses will be paid in advance if the wireless security system is not on a contract basis.
