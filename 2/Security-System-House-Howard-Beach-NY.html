Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with many systems using growth and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to manually remove to move the information? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
