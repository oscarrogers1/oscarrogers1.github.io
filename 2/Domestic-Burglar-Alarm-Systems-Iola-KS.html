<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
