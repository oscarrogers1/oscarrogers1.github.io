The $260 Essentials bundle consists of the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a backyard sign, and 2 window decals. For $15 each month, you can add around-the-clock expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control by means of iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and e-mail notifies, and 30-day event-footage storage for limitless cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available separately.
