<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police capability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire communities (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed homes) a ineffective and expensive method to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
