<h3>Security Systems For Houses Nanuet NY 10954</h3>
<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day iteration of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little bit more costly, they use a number of functions that analog cameras do not.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
